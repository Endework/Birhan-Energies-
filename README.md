## Brent Oil Price Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project investigating the impact of significant events on Brent oil prices.

### Project Goal

The main objective is to analyze how major political and economic events influence Brent oil prices. We aim to identify key events, quantify their impact on price changes, and provide data-driven insights to guide:

* **Investment strategies:** Assist stakeholders in making informed investment decisions.
* **Policy development:** Inform policymakers to create strategies for economic stability and energy security.
* **Operational planning:** Help energy companies plan operations, manage costs, and secure supply chains.

### Data

* **Historical Brent Oil Prices:** Daily prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022 (date and price in USD per barrel).
* **Additional Data Sources (Potential):** 
  * Economic indicators (World Bank, IMF): GDP, inflation, unemployment, exchange rates.
  * Technological advancements: reports on extraction techniques and renewable energy development.
  * Political and regulatory factors: environmental regulations, trade policies.

### Analysis Approach

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical Brent oil prices and explore potential additional data sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data for analysis (handling missing values, outliers, etc.).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify patterns, trends, and relationships between oil prices and other variables.
4. **Change Point Analysis:** Detect significant changes (breakpoints) in oil price behavior over time.
5. **Statistical Modeling:** Develop and evaluate time series and econometric models to capture the impact of events on prices. 
    * Potential models include ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, regime-switching models, and LSTMs.
6. **Insight Generation:** Interpret model outputs to quantify the impact of major events on oil prices.
7. **Communication:** Document findings and present clear, actionable insights for stakeholders.

###  Learning Outcomes

* **Skills:** Statistical modeling, PyMC3 (Bayesian modeling), running Python packages.
* **Knowledge:** Probability distributions, Bayesian inference, MCMC, model comparison, policy analysis.
* **Communication:** Reporting findings to stakeholders.

###  Code and Notebooks

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model development.
